# My Practice for LangChain and AI Agents and RAG Projects using Public Data

# 🧠 My LangChain Practice Projects

Welcome to my LangChain learning and project exploration repository. This repo documents my journey into building with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) — a powerful framework for creating data-aware, agent-enabled applications with LLMs.

This repo is part of my ongoing preparation to transition into a **Generative AI Solutions Architect** role, and complements my study for the **AWS AI/ML Certifications**.

---

## 🚀 Objectives

- Understand the core components of LangChain (LLMs, chains, tools, agents)
- Build end-to-end GenAI applications using LangChain + OpenAI APIs
- Explore real-world use cases: chatbots, PDF QA bots, code assistants
- Showcase hands-on experience for recruiters and collaborators

---

## 📚 Technologies & Tools

- **LangChain** (PromptTemplate, Chains, Agents, Tools)
- **OpenAI API** (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
- **Python** (3.10+)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** & `.py` scripts
- **GitHub** (for tracking learning and portfolio projects)
- **Streamlit** (for UI demos - in later stages)
- **AWS AI Services** (coming soon — integration projects)
